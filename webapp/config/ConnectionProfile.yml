# [Required]. A connection profile contains information about a set of network
# components. It is typically used to configure gateway, allowing applications
# interact with a network channel without worrying about the underlying
# topology. A connection profile is normally created by an administrator who
# understands this topology.
#
name: "Buyer Seller Network"
# [Optional]. Analogous to HTTP, properties with an "x-" prefix are deemed
# "application-specific", and ignored by the gateway. For example, property

# profile for Fabric 1.x rather than 0.x.
